# Build Integration for Static Blog Pages

## Current Status
- Metadata generation: ✅ Working (confirmed by share preview)
- Static page generation: ✅ Working locally
- Deployment integration: ❌ Needs setup

## Solution
Update your deployment platform's build command to include static blog page generation.

### For Vercel Deployment
1. **Update vercel.json or project settings** with this build command:
   ```json
   {
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/static-build",
         "config": {
           "distDir": "client/dist"
         }
       }
     ],
     "buildCommand": "vite build && tsx scripts/generate-blog-pages.ts",
     "rewrites": [
       {
         "source": "/(.*)",
         "destination": "/index.html"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** (ensure these are set):
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### For Netlify Deployment
Update netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  command = "vite build && tsx scripts/generate-blog-pages.ts"
  publish = "client/dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### Manual Integration
If you prefer to handle this manually:

1. **Before deploying**, run locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   tsx scripts/generate-blog-pages.ts
   ```

2. **Verify files generated**:
   ```
   client/dist/blog/
   ├── index.html
   └── the-complete-guide-to-workflow-automation-for-b2b-companies/
       └── index.html
   ```

3. **Deploy the complete client/dist directory**

## Expected Results
After deployment with static page generation:
- Blog post URLs will load properly
- Social sharing will show metadata (already working)
- Perfect SEO with static HTML pages
- No 404 errors on direct URL access

The static HTML files include all the metadata you see in the share preview, ensuring both search engines and social platforms can read the content immediately.
