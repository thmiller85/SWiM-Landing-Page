## Content Strategy for WordPress.com Free

### Optimizing Without Custom Fields

Since you can't use Advanced Custom Fields on the free plan, use these strategies:

#### 1. Categories for Organization
Create these categories in WordPress.com:
- **AI Solutions**
- **Workflow Automation** 
- **Case Studies**
- **Industry Insights**
- **Resources** (for downloadable content)

#### 2. Tags for Functionality
Use tags to indicate post features:
- `#consultation` - Posts that should lead to consultation CTA
- `#download` - Posts with downloadable resources
- `#newsletter` - Posts optimized for newsletter signup
- `#demo` - Posts that should promote demo requests

#### 3. Content Structure
Structure your posts consistently:
```
# Compelling Title

## Introduction
Brief hook and value proposition

## Main Content
Your valuable insights with subheadings

## Key Takeaways
- Bullet point summary
- Actionable insights

## Next Steps
[Your CTA based on post category/tags]
```

### CTA Strategy Without Custom Fields

Your React app automatically detects CTA type based on:
- **Download CTA**: Posts in "Resources" category or containing "download"
- **Newsletter CTA**: Posts tagged with "newsletter" or containing "subscribe"
- **Demo CTA**: Posts containing "demo" or in demo-related categories
- **Consultation CTA**: Default for all other posts

5. Add advanced features as needed

## Content Creation Tips for WordPress.com

### Writing Effective Posts:
1. **Start with keyword research** - Use Google Trends, Answer the Public
2. **Structure with headings** - H2, H3 for better readability
3. **Include visuals** - Upload relevant images to media library
4. **Write compelling excerpts** - These appear in your React blog listing
5. **Use categories and tags strategically** - Helps with organization and CTA targeting

### SEO Best Practices:
- Include target keywords in title and first paragraph
- Write descriptive excerpts (meta descriptions)
- Use alt text for images
- Include internal links between posts
- Keep URLs clean and descriptive

## Troubleshooting WordPress.com Integration

### Common Issues:

**Posts not showing in React app:**

- Check that posts are published (not draft)
- Test REST API directly: yoursite.wordpress.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts

**Images not loading:**
- Ensure featured images are set in WordPress.com
- Check that image URLs are accessible
- WordPress.com handles image optimization automatically

**CORS errors:**
- Usually not an issue with WordPress.com
- If problems occur, contact WordPress.com support

## WordPress.com vs Self-Hosted Decision Matrix

| Feature | WordPress.com Free | Self-Hosted |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Cost** | $0/month | $7-25/month |
| **Setup Time** | 15 minutes | 1-2 hours |
| **Maintenance** | Zero | Ongoing |
| **Custom Fields** | No | Yes |
| **Plugin Support** | No | Yes |
| **Domain** | Subdomain | Custom |
| **Branding** | WordPress.com | Your brand |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Unlimited |

## Recommendation

**Start with WordPress.com free** for your MVP because:
1. Zero cost to validate your content strategy
2. Professional content creation experience
3. Immediate integration with your React app
4. Easy upgrade path when you need advanced features
5. Focus on content creation rather than technical setup

You can always migrate to self-hosted WordPress later when your content marketing proves successful and you need advanced features like custom fields, analytics tracking, or your own domain.

The key is getting started with content creation and audience building - WordPress.com free tier is perfect for this stage.
