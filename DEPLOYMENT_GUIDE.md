# Deployment Guide - Blog URL and Metadata Fix

## Changes Made

The blog system has been updated to properly handle shared URLs and metadata generation:

✅ **Server-side rendering for blog posts** - Blog post URLs now generate proper HTML with metadata on the server
✅ **Full-stack deployment configuration** - Updated `vercel.json` to support Node.js backend with database
✅ **Proper URL routing** - Blog post links will no longer result in 404 errors when shared
✅ **Rich metadata generation** - Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD structured data for blog posts

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment platform:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Redeploy
Push the latest changes to trigger a new deployment. The updated `vercel.json` configuration will:
- Run the Node.js backend for API routes and blog post rendering
- Serve static assets for the React frontend
- Handle blog post URLs with proper metadata injection

### 3. Test Blog URL Sharing
After deployment:
1. Navigate to your blog post: `https://yoursite.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-workflow-automation-for-b2b-companies`
2. Copy the URL and paste it in a new browser tab - should load properly
3. Test social media sharing - metadata should appear correctly

## Technical Details

### Server-side Rendering
Blog post URLs (`/blog/:slug`) are now handled by the server, which:
- Fetches post data from the database
- Generates HTML with proper meta tags
- Includes Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD structured data
- Returns SEO-optimized HTML for crawlers and social platforms

### Production vs Development
- **Development**: Includes Vite HMR scripts and serves from `/src/main.tsx`
- **Production**: Serves built assets from `/assets/` directory

### Fallback Behavior
If a blog post isn't found in the database, the route falls back to standard SPA routing.

## Troubleshooting

**404 Errors**: Ensure database is properly connected and contains published blog posts
**Missing Metadata**: Check that `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set
**Deployment Issues**: Verify Node.js runtime is enabled on your hosting platform

The blog system now provides proper URL handling and rich metadata for sharing across all platforms.
