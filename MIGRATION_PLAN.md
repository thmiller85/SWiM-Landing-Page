# Next.js Migration Plan with Rollback Strategy

## Phase 1: Backup Current Configuration âœ“
- Create backup of working Vite + Express setup
- Document current file structure and dependencies
- Test current deployment works before migration

## Phase 2: Next.js Setup (Safe)
- Install Next.js alongside existing setup
- Create parallel structure in `/nextjs-app` directory
- Keep current setup fully functional during migration

## Phase 3: Incremental Migration
- Move API routes first (lowest risk)
- Migrate database layer
- Convert React components to Next.js pages
- Test each component as we go

## Phase 4: Deployment Switch
- Update deployment configuration
- Test in production
- Switch DNS/routing if successful

## Rollback Strategy
- Current Vite setup remains in project root
- Next.js app in separate directory
- Can switch back instantly via deployment config
- All data preserved (database unchanged)

## Success Criteria
- Admin dashboard fully functional
- SEO optimization working
- All API endpoints operational
- Performance equal or better

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 15 minutes (backup)
- Phase 2: 30 minutes (setup)
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours (migration)
- Phase 4: 30 minutes (deployment)

Total: ~4 hours with testing
